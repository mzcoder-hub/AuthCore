# AuthCore – SSO Authentication & User Management

**AuthCore** is a modern authentication server and user management backend built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), and PostgreSQL. It provides robust SSO (Single Sign-On), multi-application support, role-based access control (RBAC), permission management, and auditing for modern SaaS, internal tools, or enterprise environments.

## 🚀 Features

- **JWT & Opaque Token Authentication** (Access & Refresh)
- **Multi-Application Client Support**
- **User Management** (CRUD, RBAC, multi-app assignment)
- **Role & Permission Management** (with granular assignment)
- **Dynamic CORS Whitelisting**
- **Audit Logging** (for compliance and tracking)
- **RESTful API (with Swagger Docs)**
- **Secure Password Hashing**
- **Extensible Schema for Enterprise**

## ✨ Getting Started

### 1. **Clone & Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/authcore.git
cd authcore
npm install
````

### 2. **Configure Environment**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust settings as needed:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/authcore
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHCORE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHCORE_CLIENT_ID=authcore-dashboard-client
```

### 3. **Run Migrations & Seed Data**

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma db seed
```

> *This will set up demo users, applications, roles, and permissions.*

### 4. **Start the Server**

npm run start:dev
# or for production
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

## 📝 API Documentation

Swagger/OpenAPI is available at [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs) after starting the server.

A full [Postman Collection](postman_collection.json) is included in the repo for quick API testing.
